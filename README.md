class-instance-overlap
======================

Construct a class and some instances that match upon Integer but not Maybe Integer. Explore the
case until there's a clear explanation.

There are five examples. Three of them work, other two are commented out.
The working ones are: `exampleInteger`, `exampleArbitrary`, `exampleFoldable`.
The failing ones are: `exampleArbitrary'`, `exampleFoldable'`.
